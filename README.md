# Gittuf Trust Relationships Visualization 🎯

Ever wanted to see trust relationships in a way that doesn't make your brain hurt? Well, here's a visualization that does just that! This interactive DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) shows you the who's who of trust in your gittuf setup.

## Features That Make Life Easier 🎨

- **Interactive Graph**: Zoom, pan, and explore your trust relationships like a pro
- **Smart Highlighting**: Click nodes to see trust paths light up like a Christmas tree
- **Timeline View**: Travel through time to see how your policies evolved (no DeLorean needed)
- **Minimap**: Never get lost in your trust maze with this handy overview
- **Search**: Find nodes faster than you can say "where's that key?"
- **Export**: Save your masterpiece as PNG or SVG (perfect for showing off)

## How to Run (It's Easier Than Making Coffee) ☕

1. Clone this repo (you know the drill)
2. Navigate to the visualization folder
3. Run this magic command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000

4. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:8000/trust-dag.html`
5. Voilà! Your trust relationships are now visible and interactive
